# ðŸš§ REVIEW PENDING - Potentially Obsolete Files

The following files were flagged during cleanup but require manual review before removal:

## Files with Ambiguous References

- `.prettierrc` - Appears to be for general JavaScript/TypeScript formatting
- `.prettierrc.json` - Contains Solidity-specific configuration

## Review Process

For each file listed above:

1. Check if imports/references are actual dependencies or false positives
2. Verify if the file serves any runtime purpose
3. Check if it's used in specific environments (dev, test, prod)
4. If confirmed obsolete, move to next cleanup phase

## Action Items

- [ ] Review all flagged files
